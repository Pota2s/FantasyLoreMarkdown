# Non-Sapient Hazards

## Definition

Non-sapient hazards are entities or phenomena that **lack consciousness, agency, identity, or moral capacity**.  
They do not make choices, hold values, or possess selves.

They are not people, not cultures, and not failed persons.

Imperial doctrine treats non-sapient hazards as **infrastructure failures, ecological threats, or magical malfunctions**, to be neutralized, contained, or corrected without moral deliberation.

Sapience is the line.  
Anything that does not cross it is not a moral actor.

## Necromantic Failure Hazards

### Reanimated Skeletons

Reanimated skeletons are non-sapient constructs sustained entirely by necromantic influence or catastrophic magical error.

They possess:
- no consciousness,
- no memory,
- no capacity for learning or intention.

Their behavior is governed by crude pattern-matching, typically targeting humanoid shapes or movement.

They are not evil.  
They are not tragic.  
They are **systems that should not be running**.

Imperial response:
- containment,
- neutralization of animating magic,
- respectful disposal of remains,
- investigation of necromantic source.

### Hungry Corpses (Colloquial: “Zombies”)

Hungry corpses are animated bodies raised through the same pathways as reanimated skeletons, distinguished only by retained flesh.

They are **not sapient** and do not retain:
- identity,
- personality,
- memory,
- or awareness.

Their “hunger” is not desire or suffering.  
It is a **control loop**, typically keyed to organic matter, motion, or proximity.

They do not reason.  
They do not recognize individuals.  
They do not improve or adapt meaningfully.

Hungry corpses are categorically distinct from Reborn (Emergent Persons).

Imperial classification: non-sapient necromantic hazard.

### Partial Necromantic Failures

Partial necromantic failures are **malfunctioning animations** that never achieve stable hazard behavior.

Common forms include:
- incomplete animation (spasms, repeated motions),
- miskeyed instructions (incorrect or nonsensical behavior loops),
- environment-anchored animation (movement limited to a ritual zone),
- rapid-decay failures (brief animation followed by collapse).

These states never produce sapience or partial personhood.

There is no:
- lingering soul,
- confused consciousness,
- transitional undead state,
- or “almost a person” outcome.

Partial failures are treated as **cleanup events**, not entities.

## Magical and Elemental Hazards

### Full Elementals

Full elementals are mindless manifestations of raw elemental imbalance.

They do not think, plan, or choose targets.  
They enforce elemental gradients (heat, pressure, motion, mass) indiscriminately.

Anything not aligned to their element is treated as resistance.

Elementals are:
- not spirits,
- not demons,
- not beings with perspective.

They are **disasters with motion**.

Imperial response focuses on:
- dispersal,
- rebalancing mana flow,
- or collapsing the structure sustaining the manifestation.

### Void Leeches

Void leeches are non-sapient entities that consume **magical structure**, not matter.

They target:
- enchantments,
- wards,
- active spellwork,
- residual magical coherence.

People are harmed incidentally, not intentionally.

Void leeches are considered **infrastructure-level threats** and are typically neutralized through counterspelling, mana suppression, or flow invalidation.

## Biological and Ecological Hazards

### Slimes

Slimes are mindless, amorphous organisms with no nervous system or consciousness.

They consume indiscriminately and persist only while environmental conditions allow.

They do not feel pain, fear, or intent.

Slimes are treated as **biological or magical pests**, depending on origin.

### Mana-Boosted Wildlife

Some animals exposed to sustained mana flow grow larger, tougher, or more aggressive.

They remain animals:
- instinct-driven,
- territorial,
- and non-sapient.

Danger arises from scale and environment, not malice.

---

## Construct and Residual Hazards

### Uncontrolled Animated Objects / Feral Constructs

Objects animated by residual enchantment, broken wards, or degraded control systems.

They follow outdated, incomplete, or malformed instructions.

They do not improvise or reason.

Danger comes from:
- momentum,
- mass,
- and persistence.

### Echo Forms

Residual magical patterns left by intense events (rituals, battles, catastrophes).

They replay fragments of action without awareness or adaptation.

They are not undead, spirits, or memories.

They are **magical inertia**.

## Explicit Exclusions

The following are **not** non-sapient hazards:

- Reborn (Emergent Persons)  
- Spirits  
- Any sapient race or culture  
- Beings capable of agency or consent  

Non-sapient hazards are never used to imply moral failure of a people or group.

## Narrative Use

Non-sapient hazards exist to:
- provide conflict without racial essentialism,
- represent systemic or infrastructural failure,
- allow action without ethical ambiguity.

They are resolved through competence, preparation, and correction of underlying conditions.

They do not demand moral debate.

## Core Principle

> **Sapience defines personhood.  
> Absence of sapience defines hazard.**

The empire does not punish hazards.  
It fixes them.
