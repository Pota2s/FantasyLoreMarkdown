## Emergent Persons (Commonly: “Reborn”)

**Overview**  
Emergent Persons are rare sapient beings that arise following biological death without the use of revival magic or necromantic control. Despite originating in a deceased body, an Emergent Person is **not** the continuation, return, or restoration of the deceased individual.

Under imperial law, the deceased is considered fully dead. The Emergent Person is recognized as a **new civic individual**, distinct in identity, memory, and legal standing.

Emergent Persons are uncommon but documented, occurring most frequently in regions with unusually high ambient mana density.

**Origin & Ontology**  
Emergence is understood as a spontaneous phenomenon linked to environmental magical saturation rather than intent, will, or divine action. The process does not preserve memories, personality, or subjective continuity of the deceased.

An Emergent Person awakens without personal history, emotional attachment to the prior life, or claim to the deceased’s identity. Any resemblance is physical only.

Revival magic restores continuity.  
Necromancy imposes control.  
Emergence does neither.

**Biology & Physical State**  
Emergent Persons possess stable, magically sustained bodies. They do not experience decay, hunger, thirst, or fatigue, and their bodies maintain a healthy baseline without special upkeep.

Sensation functions largely normally, though some report muted extremes (e.g., pain or taste). These differences are considered quirks rather than impairments.

Emergent Persons are not inherently immortal, indestructible, or fragile. They can live ordinary lives under ordinary conditions.

**Legal Status**  
Imperial law recognizes Emergent Persons as full persons upon verification of sapience and autonomy.

They do **not** inherit:

-   the deceased’s name
    
-   property or titles
    
-   familial obligations
    
-   debts or legal liabilities
    

They may choose a new legal name and are issued fresh civic registration.

Transporting a deceased body to high-mana regions with the intent of inducing emergence, or coercing an Emergent Person to assume the identity or role of the deceased, is classified as a serious crime involving identity coercion and unlawful manipulation of personhood.

**Care & Sanctuaries**  
In cases where no family or community is willing or able to support an Emergent Person, the state provides access to transitional sanctuaries.

These facilities are not medical containment centers, but support institutions offering:

-   orientation and education
-   legal registration assistance
-   identity counseling
-   voluntary placement services

Their purpose is to support social emergence, not to restrict movement or autonomy.

**Cultural Practices**  
In some high-mana regions, families who have lost someone may choose to raise an Emergent Person as a _new child_, explicitly acknowledging the discontinuity of identity. This practice is cultural, not mandated, and is legally distinct from inheritance or succession.

Other regions treat Emergent Persons with discomfort, curiosity, or formality. Cultural responses vary widely.

**Common Misconceptions**

-   Emergent Persons are not the deceased “coming back.”
-   Emergence cannot be reliably induced or controlled.
-   Emergent Persons do not owe loyalty or obligation to the deceased’s family.
-   They are not necromantic constructs or cursed beings.
    

**Narrative Notes**  
Emergent Persons are intended to explore themes of identity without continuity, birth without childhood, and care without ownership. They are not meant to undermine the finality of death, but to examine how societies respond when new people appear in unexpected ways.
