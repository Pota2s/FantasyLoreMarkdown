## Werewolves

**Overview**  
Werewolves are a sapient humanoid race integrated into imperial society. They are not cursed, feral by default, or morally unstable. Lycanthropy in this setting is a biological and magical condition characterized by cyclical physiological surges rather than loss of agency.

Werewolves are legally recognized as full persons under imperial law and are held to the same standards of accountability as any other citizen.

**Biology & Traits**  
Werewolves experience periodic lunar-linked surges, most strongly associated with the full moon. During these periods, they may exhibit increased strength, endurance, aggression, heightened senses, and restlessness. These changes do not remove moral agency or decision-making capacity.

The surge is predictable, temporary, and non-random. Outside of these periods, werewolves are physiologically similar to baseline humanoids, though often possessing above-average resilience and recovery.

Importantly, werewolves do not involuntarily “go feral.” Violence during a surge is not excused as destiny or loss of control. The condition explains pressure, not outcomes.

**Surge Management & Law**  
Imperial law treats lunar surges as a known, manageable condition. Werewolves are expected to take reasonable precautions during surge periods, including schedule adjustments, self-isolation when appropriate, or structured activity to safely expend excess energy.

Failure to manage a known surge responsibly may be treated as negligence, not as an unavoidable accident.

To support this, the empire recognizes surge accommodations, including:

-   Flexible scheduling or leave during full moons
    
-   Restricted-duty roles when necessary
    
-   Access to containment-safe environments or supervised labor
    

These measures are framed as civic infrastructure, not special privilege.

**Employment & Lunar Labor**  
Some industries actively employ werewolves for work aligned with full-moon surges, such as disaster response, heavy labor, monster control, border defense, or other short-duration high-intensity tasks.

Such employment is legal and socially accepted when participation is voluntary, compensated appropriately, and regulated to prevent coercion or exploitation. Contracts often specify lunar availability and hazard pay.

Cultural attitudes vary: some werewolves avoid surge work entirely, while others treat the full moon as a professional asset rather than a liability.

**Social Integration**  
Werewolves are socially common and generally indistinguishable from humans outside of surge periods. This has historically contributed to smoother integration and fewer myth-driven prejudices compared to more visually distinct races.

Casual references to lunar scheduling (“oh, it’s a full moon tonight”) are common and treated similarly to discussions of health conditions or availability constraints.

**Common Misconceptions**

-   Werewolves do not lose moral agency under the full moon.
-   Full moons do not compel violence.
-   Lycanthropy is not a curse or punishment.
-   Werewolves are not inherently dangerous outside of mismanaged surge conditions.
    

**Narrative Notes**  
Werewolves are used to explore themes of biological pressure, responsibility, accommodation versus exploitation, and institutional trust. Humor often arises from mundane scheduling conflicts, workplace overconfidence (“it’ll be fine, it’s a full moon”), and the normalization of something that outsiders expect to be dramatic.
