# Cultural Variants of Imperial Nobility

## General Principle

Some cultures within the empire maintain **traditional or domain-specific noble titles** alongside imperial ones.

These titles:
- carry the same legal authority as their imperial equivalents,
- are recognized by imperial law,
- and are used primarily in local contexts.

In formal imperial documents, the imperial title is always listed.  
In local usage, the cultural title is preferred.

## Ratkin Nobility Titles

Ratkin nobility emphasizes **connectivity, stewardship, and infrastructural responsibility** rather than territorial dominance.

Ratkin titles often refer to *nodes*, *depth*, or *coordination*.

### Major Ratkin Titles

**Nodewarden**  
(Imperial equivalent: Duke)  
A Nodewarden governs a major undercity hub or logistical nexus connecting multiple regions.

Authority derives from control of movement, access, and continuity rather than land area.

**Deepwarden**  
(Imperial equivalent: Count / Count)  
Responsible for a large subterranean district or network beneath a city or region.

**Tunnel-Lord / Tunnel-Lady**  
(Imperial equivalent: Baron)  
Oversees specific tunnel systems, access routes, or maintenance corridors.

These titles are widely used in speech, even when the imperial title is known.

### Major Tidekin Titles

**Harbormaster-Regent**  
(Imperial equivalent: Duke)  
A ruler responsible for an entire coastal city or major port system.

The title emphasizes stewardship of maritime flow rather than political dominance.

**Tidewarden**  
(Imperial equivalent: Marquess or Count)  
Governs flood-prone regions, deltas, or unstable coastal borders.

This title carries strong connotations of trust and preparedness.

**Current-Keeper**  
(Imperial equivalent: Baron)  
Responsible for canals, locks, submerged districts, or specific water systems.

- Individuals may use their cultural title in informal or local settings.
- Imperial officials default to imperial titles in documentation.
- Using the *wrong* title is not illegal, but can be socially telling.
- Some nobles deliberately switch titles depending on audience.

## Narrative Notes

Cultural titles exist to reinforce that nobility is **functional, contextual, and lived**, not monolithic.

They should add texture, not confusion.
