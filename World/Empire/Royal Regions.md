### King / Queen as Ruling Noble

In cases where the King or Queen (royal consort) also holds a ruling noble title over a region, additional conventions apply to preserve administrative continuity.

### Royal Regions

Any region directly governed by a King or Queen is formally designated as a **Royal Region**.

This designation:
- prefixes the region’s name with “Royal” in official use,
- signals direct association with the Imperial Household,
- and carries elevated ceremonial significance.

Examples:
- Royal Coast of Aurelion
- Royal March of Highwater

The “Royal” designation does **not** alter tax obligations, legal protections, or civic rights by default. It is a status marker, not a privilege multiplier.

### Automatic Regency

Because the King or Queen is expected to spend extended periods in the capital or on imperial duties, **automatic regency** is mandatory for Royal Regions.

A Regent is:
- selected according to pre-established regional succession law,
- confirmed by imperial registry in advance,
- and empowered to exercise full regional authority during the monarch-consort’s absence.

Regency is procedural, not discretionary.

No special declaration is required for a Regent to assume authority when:
- the King or Queen is present in the capital,
- engaged in imperial duties,
- incapacitated,
- or otherwise unable to fulfill regional obligations.

---

### Authority of the Regent

During regency:
- the Regent exercises all normal governing authority of the region,
- decisions made are fully binding and legitimate,
- and no retroactive approval is required upon the monarch-consort’s return.

The Regent does not rule *in place of* the King or Queen, but **on behalf of the region**, ensuring uninterrupted governance.

---

### Return of Authority

When the King or Queen resumes regional duties:
- authority reverts automatically,
- no dismissal ceremony or formal handover is required,
- and all acts of the Regent remain valid.

---

### Narrative Notes

Royal Regions exist to:
- prevent power vacuums,
- avoid concentration of authority in a single individual,
- and normalize absence as a structural reality of governance.

Automatic regency ensures that **no region is ever governed by neglect**, even when its ruler is one of the empire’s most visible figures.
