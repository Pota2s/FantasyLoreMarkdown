# Imperial Nobility Titles

## Core Principle

Imperial nobility exists to **administer, maintain, and safeguard essential functions of the empire**.

Titles are not symbols of inherent worth, divine favor, or racial superiority.  
They are legal designations tied to **responsibility, jurisdiction, and continued necessity**.

Nobility is semi-hereditary:
- families may retain titles across generations,
- but titles can be revoked if duties are neglected or rendered obsolete.

## High Nobility

### Emperor / Empress

The Emperor or Empress is the supreme executive authority of the empire.

Responsibilities include:
- ratifying imperial law,
- coordinating large-scale military and civil response,
- mediating disputes between high nobles,
- and representing the empire in matters of external diplomacy.

The imperial throne is **not immutable**.  
Historical precedent establishes that abdication and dynastic replacement may occur without total collapse, provided continuity of governance is maintained.

### King / Queen (Royal Consort)

The King or Queen is the primarily ceremonial title granted to the royal consort. It does not hold any authority.

Responsibilities Include:
- representing the empire ceremonially,
- supporting diplomatic engagements,
- overseeing charitable or cultural institutions,
- or acting as an advisor at the Emperor’s or Empress’ discretion.

While the King or Queen cannot issue binding rulings, their **interpretation and articulation of the Emperor’s intent** carries significant informal weight. Nobles and officials often treat such interpretations as credible guidance, particularly where imperial rulings leave room for discretion.

In cases of contradiction, the Emperor’s or Empress’ word always takes precedence.

Culturally, the Emperor and their royal consort are referred to as "The Crown", often being addressed as "Their majesties".

### Prince / Princess (Imperial Family)

Members of the imperial family hold no automatic governing authority by title alone.

Their expected role is:
- oversight,
- investigation,
- diplomatic representation,
- and support of imperial institutions.

Princes and princesses frequently act as **problem-solvers**, not rulers.

## Regional Nobility

### Archduke / Archduchess

Archdukes govern large, strategically critical regions (multiple provinces or equivalent).

Responsibilities include:
- coordination of regional defense,
- arbitration between ducal houses,
- and long-term infrastructural planning.

This title is rare and typically granted only where centralized coordination is essential.

### Duke / Duchess

Dukes govern major regions, cities, or domains whose stability is vital to imperial continuity.

Ducal authority includes:
- regional law enforcement,
- taxation oversight,
- and coordination of subordinate nobles.

Dukes are expected to maintain functional governance rather than ceremonial prestige.

## Domain Nobility

### Marquess / Marchioness

Marquesses govern **marches** — border regions adjacent to foreign powers, unstable territories, or areas of persistent external threat.

While comparable in territorial scale to Counts, Marquesses are **explicitly entrusted with greater discretion and authority**.

Responsibilities include:
- border defense and early response,
- intelligence gathering and threat assessment,
- negotiation or deterrence with external actors,
- and maintaining readiness without provoking escalation.

Marquesses are generally **trusted more than Counts**, as their role requires independent judgment, rapid decision-making, and sustained reliability.

Appointment to a march is considered both an honor and a burden.

### Count / Countess

Counts administer defined territories such as cities, clusters of towns, or specialized domains.

Examples include:
- inland trade hubs,
- fortified internal regions,
- canal and river systems away from borders.

Counts are expected to maintain stability within established imperial frameworks and typically operate under closer oversight than Marquesses.

### Baron / Baroness

Barons govern smaller or more specialized jurisdictions.

These may include:
- border towns under a Marquess’s authority,
- critical roads or passes,
- flood control districts,
- or industrial zones.

Baronial titles are frequently created or dissolved as needs change.

## Functional Nobility (Non-Territorial)

These titles are granted based on **domain authority**, not land ownership.

### Steward

Stewards oversee essential systems that cut across territorial boundaries.

Examples:
- food distribution networks,
- logistics coordination,
- emergency response frameworks.

A Steward’s authority applies only within their functional scope.

### Warden

Wardens are responsible for **containment, protection, or risk management**.

Examples:
- magical containment zones,
- unstable regions,
- disaster-prone territories.

Wardens may command resources temporarily during crises.

### Prefect

Prefects manage administrative regions or systems on behalf of higher nobles.

This title emphasizes:
- regulation,
- compliance,
- and procedural enforcement.

Prefects rarely hold hereditary authority.

## Minor Nobility

### Lord / Lady

A general designation for nobles whose authority is limited in scope or symbolic in nature.

Often used as:
- courtesy titles,
- transitional appointments,
- or informal address for lesser nobles.

---

### Knight / Dame

Knighthood is a **personal title**, not a governing one.

Granted for:
- exceptional service,
- sustained contribution,
- or specialized expertise.

Knights may come from any background and do not pass the title to descendants.

---

## Racial and Cultural Neutrality

All noble titles are **species-neutral**.

Ratkin, Tidekin, elves, dwarves, humans, and others may hold any title appropriate to their responsibilities.

Titles reflect **function**, not form.

---

## Revocation and Succession

Titles may be revoked if:
- duties are neglected,
- authority is abused,
- or the function ceases to exist.

Succession is expected but **not guaranteed**.  
Heirs must demonstrate competence or risk reassignment of the title.

---

## Narrative Notes

Imperial nobility is designed to feel:
- administrative rather than aristocratic,
- practical rather than mythic,
- and stable without being immutable.

Border titles, especially Marquessates, are intentionally high-trust and high-risk appointments.

## Summary

> Nobility is not who you are.  
> Nobility is what you are responsible for.
