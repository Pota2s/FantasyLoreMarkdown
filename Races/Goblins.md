## Goblins

**Overview**  
Goblins are a fully sapient humanoid people characterized by extreme adaptability to unstable environments. They thrive in regions where systems are incomplete, failing, or actively contested.

Goblins are not inherently violent, criminal, or chaotic. They are **situational optimizers** who prioritize survival and opportunity over long-term institutional loyalty.

**Biology & Physical Traits**  
Goblins are generally smaller than humans and orcs, with builds favoring agility, endurance, and rapid adaptation rather than brute strength.

Their biology supports:

-   fast learning in new environments,
-   high tolerance for risk,
-   and resilience under poor living conditions.
    

These traits encourage opportunistic behavior but do not dictate moral alignment.

**Psychology & Cultural Tendencies**  
Goblins tend to:

-   distrust long-term stability claims,
-   exploit loopholes and gaps in systems,
-   abandon failing structures early rather than reform them,
-   and treat legality as contextual rather than absolute.
    

This makes them excellent at surviving collapse—and frustrating to bureaucracies built on continuity.

Goblins are not amoral, but their ethics are **local rather than abstract**. What matters is whether something works _here and now_.

**Warbands & Violence**  
Goblin warbands form readily in regions with weak military presence or enforcement. These warbands are not cultural imperatives; they are adaptive configurations.

A goblin may:

-   join a warband temporarily,
-   leave when conditions change,
-   or never join one at all.
    

Warbands dissolve as readily as they form.

**Goblins in the Empire**  
Goblins exist throughout imperial territory as:

-   traders,
-   scavengers,
-   fixers,
-   laborers,
-   and residents of marginal zones.
    

They are citizens where settled, but often remain underrepresented in elite institutions due to their aversion to long-term abstraction and delayed reward systems.

Imperial authorities often associate goblins with instability, which goblins correctly interpret as the empire blaming them for problems it has not resolved.

**Relations with Orcs**  
Goblins frequently ally with orcs. Orcs value goblins’ moral flexibility and wide aptitudes; goblins value orcs’ physical security and decisiveness.

These alliances are cooperative, not submissive.

**Common Misconceptions**

-   Goblins are not inherently treacherous.
-   They are not unintelligent or incapable of planning.
-   They are not universally hostile to law—only skeptical of its permanence.
    

**Narrative Notes**  
Goblins are used to explore systemic failure, opportunism, and the difference between survival logic and institutional logic. Conflict involving goblins should arise from instability, not racial villainy.
