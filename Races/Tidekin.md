## Tidekin

**Overview**  
Tidekin are a fully sapient humanoid people adapted to aquatic and semi-aquatic environments. They are most commonly found in coastal cities, river deltas, wetlands, and canal networks throughout the empire.

They are not monsters, not guardians of the deep, and not inherently martial. Tidekin are people whose biology makes water, pressure, and exposure _inconveniences rather than threats_.

**Biology & Physical Traits**  
Tidekin possess reptilian features adapted for aquatic life, most notably scales that provide natural protection. Their scales are tough, resilient, and naturally resistant to abrasion, pressure, and minor impacts.

This gives Tidekin a visibly “hard” exterior, which often leads to incorrect assumptions about their temperament.

Key traits include:

-   dense, protective scales that function as natural armor,
-   strong swimming ability and excellent breath control (many can breathe underwater),
-   tolerance for cold water and shifting pressure,
-   muscular builds optimized for endurance rather than explosive strength.

Despite their appearance, Tidekin physiology is not inherently aggressive. Their toughness is **environmental**, not behavioral.

**Temperament & Cultural Perception**  
Because of their scales and physical resilience, Tidekin are often perceived as stoic, intimidating, or unapproachable. In practice, this is mostly a surface-level misunderstanding.

Tidekin cultures tend to value:

-   patience over speed,
-   preparedness over improvisation,
-   and durability over elegance.

This produces a calm, steady demeanor that can read as severity to outsiders. Among themselves, Tidekin are often dryly humorous, practical, and unflappable rather than stern.

**Environment & Settlement Patterns**  
Tidekin settlements cluster around:

-   coastlines and harbors,
-   river mouths and floodplains,
-   canal-dense cities,
-   and partially submerged infrastructure.
    

They are especially common in places where water levels fluctuate unpredictably. Rather than fight these conditions, Tidekin architecture and planning assume periodic flooding as normal.

Many Tidekin cities and districts are designed with:

-   layered walkways,
-   amphibious access points,
-   submerged maintenance corridors,
-   and flood-resilient storage.

**Occupational Tendencies**  
Tidekin are disproportionately represented in roles involving:

-   harbor management and port authority,
-   flood control and levee maintenance,
-   underwater construction and inspection,
-   salvage and recovery operations,
-   canal and lock supervision,
-   maritime disaster response.

They are rarely front-line soldiers by doctrine, but are invaluable in keeping fleets, ports, and coastal cities operational during crises.

**Nobility & Governance**  
Tidekin noble houses are most common in coastal cities where control of water infrastructure is strategically essential. Noble status among Tidekin families is typically justified through generations of effective stewardship rather than lineage prestige alone.

A Tidekin noble house is expected to:

-   manage harbor defenses and navigation safety,
-   coordinate flood mitigation and evacuation planning,
-   oversee underwater wards and infrastructure,
-   and maintain trade continuity during storms or naval disruptions.

Their authority is widely accepted in coastal regions due to consistent, practical governance.

**Social Integration**  
Tidekin are fully integrated into imperial society. Their presence in leadership positions is generally viewed as sensible rather than controversial, particularly in regions where water defines daily life.

Inland populations may find Tidekin nobles unusual at first, but rarely dispute their competence once exposed to the realities of coastal governance.

**Common Misconceptions**

-   Tidekin are not cold or emotionless; they are measured.
-   Their toughness is biological adaptation, not aggression.
-   They are not inherently militaristic despite their natural armor.
-   Their culture is shaped by water management, not conquest.
    

**Narrative Notes**  
Tidekin are used to explore themes of resilience, infrastructure-first leadership, and quiet authority. Their visual toughness contrasts deliberately with their typically calm, cooperative behavior.

They are most effective in stories where danger comes from environment and logistics rather than ideology—storms, floods, collapsed canals, or maritime crises—highlighting how preparation often matters more than force.
