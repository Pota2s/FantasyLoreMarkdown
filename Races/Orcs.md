## Orcs

**Overview**  
Orcs are a fully sapient humanoid people whose cultures do not morally categorize violence in the same way most imperial societies do. Violence, to orcs, is not inherently evil or virtuous—it is a **legitimate means of problem-solving** alongside others.

This does not make orcs universally hostile, irrational, or bloodthirsty. It makes their ethical framework materially incompatible with societies that treat violence as an absolute moral failure rather than a contextual tool.

**Biology & Physical Traits**  
Orcs are generally larger and more physically robust than humans, with builds optimized for endurance, impact resistance, and sustained exertion.

Common traits include:

-   high physical resilience,
-   rapid recovery from exertion,
-   strong skeletal and muscular density,
-   and tolerance for injury that would incapacitate other races.
    

These traits do not compel violence, but they do lower its _cost_, which shapes cultural norms over time.

**Psychology & Moral Framework**  
Orc cultures typically view violence as:

-   morally neutral,
-   situationally justified,
-   and acceptable when it produces results.

To an orc, a raid can be a logistics decision. Denying an enemy manpower is strategic, not cruel. Harm is not inflicted for its own sake, but neither is it taboo.

This creates friction with imperial law, which treats violence as a last resort regulated by monopoly and procedure.

Importantly, orcs are capable of restraint, cooperation, and long-term planning. They simply do not share the assumption that violence is uniquely corrupting.

**Social Organization**  
Orc societies often organize around:

-   warbands,
-   extended kin groups,
-   or leader-centric coalitions.

These structures are fluid. Authority is maintained through demonstrated competence rather than inheritance alone. Leaders who fail are replaced quickly, sometimes violently, sometimes not.

Warbands are not permanent states. Many dissolve when conditions change.

**Orcs in the Empire**  
Within imperial borders, orcs are recognized as people and subject to the same laws as others. However, their moral framework places them in frequent conflict with imperial legal norms.

Some orcs integrate successfully into imperial society, particularly in:

-   frontier regions,
-   mercenary or security work,
-   disaster response,
-   or mixed communities where pragmatic ethics are common.
    

Others remain outside imperial control, forming independent warbands in regions with weak enforcement.

**Mixed Warbands**  
Orcs commonly cooperate with goblins and other pragmatic groups. Orcs provide physical bulk and sustained force; goblins provide adaptability and flexible methods.

These alliances are transactional rather than hierarchical.

**Common Misconceptions**

-   Orcs are not mindlessly violent.
-   They are not incapable of cooperation or empathy.
-   They do not universally enjoy suffering.
-   Their conflicts arise from incompatible ethics, not inherent malice.

**Narrative Notes**  
Orcs are used to explore moral relativism without moral equivalence. They are dangerous not because they are evil, but because their value system does not align with imperial assumptions about restraint.
