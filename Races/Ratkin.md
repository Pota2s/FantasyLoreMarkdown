## Ratkin

**Overview**  
Ratkin are a fully sapient humanoid race integrated throughout imperial society. They are not pests, scavengers, or a criminal underclass by nature. They are ordinary people whose primary distinction lies in **spatial preference and environmental adaptation**, particularly toward subterranean and volumetric living.

Ratkin are common, unremarkable, and generally unnoticed until a story involves infrastructure, logistics, or spaces other people forget exist.

**Biology & Physical Traits**  
Ratkin are roughly human-sized, though typically shorter on average (around 140 cm). They are not “small creatures,” and should not be portrayed as diminutive or childlike.

They possess:

-   excellent balance and spatial awareness,
    
-   strong night vision and low-light adaptation,
    
-   high tolerance for confined or layered environments,
    
-   and physical builds well-suited to climbing, crawling, and sustained movement in tight spaces.
    

They are biologically humanoid and require no special sustenance beyond normal food and rest.

**Environment & Living Patterns**  
Ratkin strongly prefer **subterranean or semi-subterranean environments**, including:

-   underfloor spaces,
    
-   basements and cellars,
    
-   tunnel networks,
    
-   service corridors,
    
-   layered urban infrastructure.
    

In cities, ratkin often live _below_ areas occupied by surface-dwellers. This arrangement is legal, common, and regulated. Many buildings—especially older or cheaper ones—implicitly or explicitly share space with ratkin communities.

This is not secrecy; it is **vertical zoning**.

**Social Integration**  
Ratkin are treated as normal citizens under imperial law. There is no widespread stigma attached to their presence.

Most people simply don’t think about them unless:

-   they emerge to deliver something,
    
-   a noise complaint travels upward or downward,
    
-   or infrastructure work intersects with their living spaces.
    

Ratkin are often described as “everywhere” in hindsight, because once noticed, it becomes obvious how many systems quietly rely on them.

**Occupational Tendencies**  
Ratkin are disproportionately represented in roles involving:

-   message delivery and internal logistics,
    
-   maintenance of tunnels, sewers, and foundations,
    
-   surveying and mapping of complex spaces,
    
-   disaster response in collapsed or inaccessible environments,
    
-   archival transport and secure document movement.
    

In the imperial capital, a significant portion of courier and report delivery infrastructure relies on ratkin navigating routes that bypass surface congestion entirely.

**Civic Infrastructure & Education**  
Ratkin were instrumental in the development of **three-dimensional city planning** as a formal discipline. Many universities now offer specialized courses in volumetric urban design, with ratkin forming the majority of attendees.

This discipline arose after repeated incidents where surface-oriented planning failed to account for inhabited substructures (e.g., sewer lines intersecting underground businesses).

Ratkin are not overrepresented in governance due to exclusion, but because many find surface-level political spectacle inefficient or unnecessary.

**Cultural Notes**  
Ratkin generally value:

-   practicality over display,
-   access over appearance,
-   and quiet coordination over formal hierarchy.    

They are not secretive by nature, but they do not announce themselves unless needed. Emerging from floors, walls, or hidden access points to deliver information is considered normal behavior in spaces designed with them in mind (e.g., guild halls, royal households, major administrative buildings).

**Common Misconceptions**

-   Ratkin are not small animals or pests.
-   They are not inherently sneaky or criminal.
-   Subterranean living is a preference, not a compulsion.
-   Their presence beneath a building does not imply secrecy or illegality.
    

**Narrative Notes**  
Ratkin are used to highlight infrastructural blind spots, vertical social assumptions, and the difference between visibility and importance. Humor involving ratkin should arise from **spatial expectation mismatches**, not from dehumanization.

Their integration is meant to feel so complete that characters are often surprised not by their existence, but by how much they rely on them.
