## Vampires

**Overview**  
Vampires are a sapient humanoid race fully integrated into imperial society. They are not inherently evil, cursed, or morally predisposed toward violence. Like any other people, vampires vary widely in temperament, ethics, and ambition. Their defining traits are biological and magical rather than metaphysical.

**Biology & Traits**  
Vampires possess a higher baseline magical and physical capacity than most humans. This manifests as increased longevity, enhanced resilience, and a natural aptitude for power accumulation. As a result, vampires experience stronger incentives toward ambition and escalation, but this is a pressure gradient rather than mind control or corruption.

Vampires require blood as a biological necessity. Blood consumption does not inherently cause harm if properly sourced and regulated. Hunger does not override agency, though it can impair judgment if unmanaged.

Sunlight is not lethal to vampires. Prolonged exposure may cause discomfort, fatigue, reduced regenerative capacity, or increased metabolic strain, but vampires can function normally during the day with appropriate management.

**Consent & Feeding Practices**  
Imperial law treats blood consumption involving sapient beings as an act requiring informed, legally valid consent. This includes age restrictions, absence of coercion, and revocability.

Due to recurring historical incidents—particularly involving young or newly turned vampires—the empire mandates educational mitigation programs covering consent law, power asymmetry, and feeding ethics. Failure to complete or pass these programs can result in fines, restrictions, or temporary prohibitions.

In response, vampire communities established dedicated blood banks and humanitarian blood services, operated primarily by vampires themselves. These organizations source blood through voluntary, legal means and provide safe access for vampire populations, significantly reducing legal and ethical incidents.

**Social Integration**  
Vampires are legally and socially recognized as full persons under imperial law. Slavery, ownership, or coercive control of vampires is explicitly forbidden.

They commonly occupy roles where longevity, precision, or high responsibility are valued: administration, medicine, law, scholarship, logistics, and emergency response. Some vampires intentionally limit their accumulation of power or influence as a personal or ethical choice.

Vampires are subject to the same laws as other citizens. Their power does not grant immunity from due process, and legal systems are explicitly designed to apply procedural accountability regardless of species.

**Common Misconceptions**

-   Vampires are not destroyed by sunlight.
-   Vampires are not universally predatory or evil.
-   Blood consumption is not inherently violent or criminal.
-   Vampires are not aristocratic by nature, though some pursue status aggressively due to long-term incentive structures.
    

**Narrative Notes**  
Vampires in this setting are intended to explore themes of power asymmetry, consent, overcorrection, and institutional learning. Humor often arises from vampires engaging with bureaucracy more rigorously than required, particularly regarding consent and liability.
